Smarter Workflows with Connected Hardware

Mirahelp builds technologies that connect people, devices, and data through responsive, context aware workflows.  
We bridge software and modern smart hardware to improve coordination, precision, and awareness across industries.

Gain access to sensor streams, connectivity options, and device interfaces for smart glasses and smart rings.  
Enable adaptive workflows, live monitoring, and real time interaction models allowing development teams to shape their own connected systems with full flexibility.

## Focus Areas

We design and support connected solutions for sectors where real time awareness and communication matter most.

| Industry | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Warehouse Logistics | Facilitate faster item identification, task coordination, and operational tracking in dynamic logistics environments. |
| Construction Inspection | Assist field professionals with contextual information, gesture-based input, and connected validation workflows. |
| Maritime Industry | Enable improved awareness and interaction possibilities for crews and teams operating in complex marine environments. |
| Assembly Work | Enhance coordination, measurement, and precision through wearable control and real-time data presentation. |
| Security Services | Investigate ways to support field personnel with responsive tools and connected communication devices. |
| Media Industry | Explore flexible interaction and recording setups using wearable hardware for production or monitoring workflows. |

Our open work includes projects such as the [Mirahelp BLE Toolkit](https://github.com/Mirahelp/BLE-Toolkit), while proprietary SDKs and integration frameworks are developed for enterprise and partner use.
